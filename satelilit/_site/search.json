    "text": "The escalating demand for accurate and geographically nuanced house pricing in Metro Manila necessitates innovative methods for analyzing real estate data. This project proposes an advanced analytical platform that integrates Interactive Maps, Geographically Weighted Regression Analysis Dashboards, and Cluster Analysis to provide detailed insights into house prices across Metro Manila. By leveraging real estate data scraped from Lamudi and geospatial data of the Philippines, the project aims to shed light on the spatial dynamics and factors influencing house prices.\nThrough methodologies such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Kernel Density Estimation, the platform will offer both visual and quantitative analyses to cater to different stakeholders, including potential homebuyers, real estate agents, and policymakers. This project is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional appraisal methods by offering a more localized and dynamic analysis of the real estate market."

Data Importing\nThe data importing will leverage on R libraries, such as dplyr for aspatial data, and sf for geospatial data\n\n\n3. Data Wrangling\nThe imported data undergoes cleaning and preprocessing to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This stage may involve normalization, encoding categorical variables, and data transformation to ensure compatibility with analysis methods."

Histograms reveal the distribution of rental prices and other numerical variables, while box plots identify outliers and the spread of data across categorical variables.\n\n\n2. Choropleth\nThese maps provide a visual representation of rental price variations across different geographical areas, highlighting regions with higher or lower average rental prices.\n\n\n3. Kernel Density Estimation\nKDE plots help identify the density of rental properties across the city, offering insights into high-demand areas and potential patterns of spatial clustering."

OLS regression facilitates the estimation of coefficients for each determinant, providing a baseline for comparison with more complex models.\nResults from the OLS model are evaluated to determine the significance and impact of each variable. This involves examining R-squared values, p-values, and coefficient sizes to assess model fit and variable importance."

This model captures how the influence of determinants on rental prices changes not only across space but also over time.\nThe introduction of temporal data in GTWR is evaluated by comparing its results with those of GWR and OLS models. This comparison sheds light on the temporal dynamics affecting rental prices and the added value of considering both spatial and temporal variations in the analysis."
