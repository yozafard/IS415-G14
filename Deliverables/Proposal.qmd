# 1. Abstract

This project investigates room rental price prediction in Jakarta using geospatial analysis methods to assist home owners, property agents, and potential business owners in the rental market. Through Geospatial Weighted Regression, both descriptive and predictive methods, and Kernel Density Estimation techniques, we explore the spatial dynamics and determinants of rental prices across Jakarta's diverse neighborhoods. By analyzing publicly available datasets and employing machine learning algorithms, we uncover spatial patterns, identify high-demand areas, and segment neighborhoods based on rental price similarities. The project culminates in the development of interactive visualizations that convey insights intuitively, facilitating informed decision making and strategic planning in Jakarta's evolving rental market.

# 2. Problem & Motivation

Jakarta's rapid urbanization and diverse demographic landscape present a complex challenge in understanding room rental prices. Traditional statistical methods overlook the spatial intricacies and demographic nuances that shape Jakarta's rental market dynamics. Factors like proximity to transportation, amenities, and schools contribute to the complexity. To address this, we aim to employ Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models to predict rental prices across Jakarta's neighborhoods. By capturing spatial variations in local amenities, GWR models offer tailored insights for stakeholders, enabling informed decisions amidst Jakarta's evolving urban landscape.

# 3. Project Objectives

In light of the complexities and the lack of accurate, accessible tools for analyzing rental prices in Jakarta, there is a pressing need for a more refined approach that takes into account geographical nuances and offers real-time data visualization. The project is motivated by the opportunity to leverage recent advancements in spatial analysis and data visualization technologies to address these challenges. By creating an interactive, geographically informed platform, the project aims to democratize access to real estate data, enabling potential buyers, investors, and policymakers to make more informed decisions. Additionally, the project seeks to contribute to the academic and practical understanding of real estate valuation, offering insights that could refine existing models and improve the accuracy of future real estate market analyses.

# 4. Data Source

-   Real Estate Price Data

Rental unit prices data scraped from [Mamikos](https://mamikos.com/), a popular leading property rental platform and management company in Indonesia. This dataset contains the listing price of rental units along with their respective features like size of the rooms, price, etc.

-   Geospatial data of Jakarta

A shapefile contains the borders of administrative regions of Jakarta, along with the coordinates of amenities that are in the region. This data is taken from [Indonesia Geospasial](https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/shp-rbi-provinsi-dki-jakarta-perwilayah.html).

# 5. Approach & Methodology

## 5.1 Data Preparation

### 1. Data Sourcing

Our dataset will be sourced from Mamikos, a property rental platform in Indonesia. We will be focusing only on Jakarta's rental

### 2. Data Importing

The data importing will leverage on R libraries, such as dplyr for aspatial data, and sf for geospatial data

### 3. Data Wrangling

The imported data undergoes cleaning and preprocessing to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This stage may involve normalization, encoding categorical variables, and data transformation to ensure compatibility with analysis methods.

## 5.2 Exploratory Data Analysis

### 1. Statistical Graphs: Histogram, Box Plot

Key distributions and relationships within the data are visualized using histograms and box plots. Histograms reveal the distribution of rental prices and other numerical variables, while box plots identify outliers and the spread of data across categorical variables.

### 2. Point Pattern Analysis - Kernel Density Estimation

KDE plots help identify the density of rental properties across the city, offering insights into high-demand areas and potential patterns of spatial clustering. Price will also be used as a weight in the calculation, to offer more insight on high price rentals

## 5.3 Descriptive Analytics

### 1. Multiple Linear Regression

idk what to put

### 2. Geographically Weighted Regression

Using Geographically Weighted Regression, we are aiming to give users an insight of how each feature affects the price of rental units in each region

## 5.4 Predictive Analytics

### 1. Multiple Linear Regression

We are using a standard Multiple Linear Regression to predict the price of a rental unit, based on user inputs. The user inputs would be location (taken from the address that the user inputted), the gender of the room (if it's a mixed unit, male-only, or female-only), size of the unit in meter square, and the year that the building is built or last renovated.

### 2. Geographically Weighted Random Forest

Building on the Multiple Linear Regression, we wanted to improve it further by introducing location as a geospatial feature to add more weight for closer units.

# 4. Literature Review

## 4.1 [A Spatial Regression Model for Predicting Prices of Short-Term Rentals in Athens, Greece](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/13/3/63)

### Objective

Explores the factors affecting the prices of short-term rental properties listed on Airbnb in Athens, Greece. Using spatial data analysis, the study focuses on identifying significant predictors of rental prices, including property features, host attributes, review characteristics, and various location attributes

### Methodology

1.  Multiple Regression Analysis (Ordinary Least Squares)

Explains the regression of a dependent variable over more than one independent variable

2.  Geographically Weighted Regression

A linear regression model which pays more attention to the local regression based on spatial relationship

### Learning points

![](images/litrev1.png)

Consistent across studies is the finding that location significantly influences short-term rental prices. Proximity to tourist attractions, amenities, and transport links are pivotal in determining price points.

The characteristics of the property, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, along with host-related factors like reviews and superhost status, play a crucial role in pricing

### Areas for improvement

Concentrate on the rentals with high residuals and analyze the neighborhood characteristics and the amenities they offer. In addition, replacing Euclidean distances with distances along the road network might improve the results of the OLS model

## 4.2 [Assessing the Impact of Selected Attributes on Dwelling Prices Using Ordinary Least Squares Regression and Geographically Weighted Regression: A Case Study in Poznań, Poland](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/12/1/125)

### Objective

Determine what factors affect transaction prices in Poznan, Poland.

### Methodology

1.  Ordinary Least Squares

May be biassed as the OLS method does not take into account spatial autocorrelation.

2.  Moran' I Test

Check if there are any spatial autocorrelation

3.  Geographically Weighted Regression

Allows the estimation of local coefficients based on samples within the bandwidth of a local location, which can solve the problem of spatial autocorrelation

### Learning points

OLS only explains around 23% of the variability of the observed phenomenon

After conducting Moran' I Test, the property prices seem to be spatially clustered and there is a positive spatial autocorrelation.

GWR returned an R Squared value of 0.477 and AIC of 15597.432. This indicates that GWR Performed better compared to the OLS method.

### Areas for improvement

Gathering more precise data

Usage of other methods

Feature engineering - the variables selected are based on information from local real estate offices, which might overlook other important variables

## 4.3 [Use of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) Method to Estimate the Effects of Location Attributes on the Residential Property Values](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/295045695.pdf)

### Objective

Estimate the effect of locational attributes on property values in Kuala Lumpur

### Methodology

1.  Hedonic Pricing Model (HPM)

A standard prediction model that does not take into account characteristics such as spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity

2.  Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)\
    Built on top of the HPM to prevents issues with spatial characteristics in the data

### Learning points

![](images/litrev3.png)

This shows that while a traditional HPM can explain 73% of the variances,  adding the spatial data can improve the accuracy.

The study shows that different locational attributes

have differential spatial effects on residential property

premiums across the study area.

### Areas for improvement

Interpretation on the GWR Results - we can use qualitative methods, such as focus groups on the affected areas, to get a better interpretation of the GWR results

## 4.4 [Modelling Housing Rents Using Spatial Autoregressive Geographically Weighted Regression: A Case Study in Cracow, Poland](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/6/346)

### Objective

Identify the determinants of rental prices in Cracow, Poland

### Methodology

1.  Ordinary Least Squares Regression

Insufficient as the model does not take into account spatial relationships

2.  Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR)

Includes a spatially lagged dependent variable to capture the influence of rental prices in nearby locations

3.  Mixed Geographically Weighted Regression - Spatial Autoregressive Model (MGWR-SAR)

Combined GWR with SAR

### Learning points

GWR-SAR performed the best, as it can take in both both spatial non-stationarity of the parameters of determinants and change over space of the spatial autoregressive parameter

### Areas for improvement

Exploring the thresholds of when and where spatial correlation and spatial heterogeneity becomes a significant factor in the analysis

Adapting the models to different spatial complexity, making it more portable and usable in different locations
