# 1. Abstract

This project investigates room rental price prediction in Jakarta using geospatial analysis methods to assist home owners, property agents, and potential business owners in the rental market. Through Geospatial Weighted Regression, both descriptive and predictive methods, and Kernel Density Estimation techniques, we explore the spatial dynamics and determinants of rental prices across Jakarta's diverse neighborhoods. By analyzing publicly available datasets and employing machine learning algorithms, we uncover spatial patterns, identify high-demand areas, and segment neighborhoods based on rental price similarities. The project culminates in the development of interactive visualizations that convey insights intuitively, facilitating informed decision making and strategic planning in Jakarta's evolving rental market.

# 2. Problem & Motivation

Jakarta's rapid urbanization and diverse demographic landscape present a complex challenge in understanding room rental prices. Traditional statistical methods overlook the spatial intricacies and demographic nuances that shape Jakarta's rental market dynamics. Factors like proximity to transportation, amenities, and schools contribute to the complexity. To address this, we aim to employ Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models to predict rental prices across Jakarta's neighborhoods. By capturing spatial variations in local amenities, GWR models offer tailored insights for stakeholders, enabling informed decisions amidst Jakarta's evolving urban landscape.

# 3. Project Objectives

In light of the complexities and the lack of accurate, accessible tools for analyzing rental prices in Jakarta, there is a pressing need for a more refined approach that takes into account geographical nuances and offers real-time data visualization. The project is motivated by the opportunity to leverage recent advancements in spatial analysis and data visualization technologies to address these challenges. By creating an interactive, geographically informed platform, the project aims to democratize access to real estate data, enabling potential buyers, investors, and policymakers to make more informed decisions. Additionally, the project seeks to contribute to the academic and practical understanding of real estate valuation, offering insights that could refine existing models and improve the accuracy of future real estate market analyses.

# 4. Data Source

-   Real Estate Price Data

Rental unit prices data scraped from [Mamikos](https://mamikos.com/), a popular leading property rental platform and management company in Indonesia. This dataset contains the listing price of rental units along with their respective features like size of the rooms, price, etc.

-   Geospatial data of the Philippines

A shapefile contains the borders of administrative regions of Jakarta, along with the coordinates of amenities that are in the region. This data is taken from [Indonesia Geospasial](https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/shp-rbi-provinsi-dki-jakarta-perwilayah.html).

# 5. Approach & Methodology

## 5.1 Data Preparation

### 1. Data Sourcing

Our dataset will be sourced from Mamikos, a property rental platform in Indonesia.

### 2. Data Importing

The data importing will leverage on R libraries, such as dplyr for aspatial data, and sf for geospatial data

### 3. Data Wrangling

The imported data undergoes cleaning and preprocessing to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This stage may involve normalization, encoding categorical variables, and data transformation to ensure compatibility with analysis methods.

## 5.2 Exploratory Data Analysis

### 1. Statistical Graphs: Histogram, Box Plot

Key distributions and relationships within the data are visualized using histograms and box plots. Histograms reveal the distribution of rental prices and other numerical variables, while box plots identify outliers and the spread of data across categorical variables.


### 2. Point Pattern Analysis - Kernel Density Estimation

KDE plots help identify the density of rental properties across the city, offering insights into high-demand areas and potential patterns of spatial clustering. Price will also be used as a weight in the calculation, to offer more insight on high price rentals

## 3.1 Hedonic Pricing Model - Ordinary Least Squares Regression

This foundational model assesses the impact of various property and location-specific factors on rental prices. OLS regression facilitates the estimation of coefficients for each determinant, providing a baseline for comparison with more complex models.

Results from the OLS model are evaluated to determine the significance and impact of each variable. This involves examining R-squared values, p-values, and coefficient sizes to assess model fit and variable importance.

## 3.2 Geographically Weighted Regression

Building on the OLS model, GWR introduces spatial variation in coefficients, allowing for the examination of how the impact of determinants on rental prices varies across different locations.

The results of GWR are compared to the OLS model to understand the benefits of incorporating spatial data. This comparison highlights the spatial non-stationarity of relationships between rental prices and their determinants.

## 3.3 Geographically Weighted Random Forest

# 4. Literature Review

## 4.1 [Mass Appraisal Modeling of Real Estate in Urban Centers by Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression: A Case Study of Beijing's Core Area](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/9/5/143)

### Objective

To build a more effective and accurate model that can satisfy the standard of mass appraisal with large data volumes, complex housing characteristics and high accuracy requirements by utilising the spatio-temporal characteristics of the properties

### Methodology

1.  Kernel Density Estimation

To get a better understanding of the distribution of the property prices

2.  Multiple Regression Analysis (Ordinary Least Squares)

Explains the regression of a dependent variable over more than one independent variable

3.  Geographically Weighted Regression

A linear regression model which pays more attention to the local regression based on spatial relationship

4.  Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression

Introducing the time variable to the regression model

### Learning points

![](images/litrev1.png)

MRA with OLS can explain about 56% of the information, which is better than GWR with only 22%. However, adding the time variable improved the prediction to 82%

### Areas for improvement

Using data for the entire city, not only in Beijing's core area.

Using rental data that has higher frequency compared to transaction data. This can better describe the housing value from the perspective of residence and usage rather than investment.

## 4.2 [Assessing the Impact of Selected Attributes on Dwelling Prices Using Ordinary Least Squares Regression and Geographically Weighted Regression: A Case Study in Poznań, Poland](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/12/1/125)

### Objective

Determine what factors affect transaction prices in Poznan, Poland.

### Methodology

1.  Ordinary Least Squares

May be biassed as the OLS method does not take into account spatial autocorrelation.

2.  Moran' I Test

Check if there are any spatial autocorrelation

3.  Geographically Weighted Regression

Allows the estimation of local coefficients based on samples within the bandwidth of a local location, which can solve the problem of spatial autocorrelation

### Learning points

OLS only explains around 23% of the variability of the observed phenomenon

After conducting Moran' I Test, the property prices seem to be spatially clustered and there is a positive spatial autocorrelation.

GWR returned an R Squared value of 0.477 and AIC of 15597.432. This indicates that GWR Performed better compared to the OLS method.

### Areas for improvement

Gathering more precise data

Usage of other methods

Feature engineering - the variables selected are based on information from local real estate offices, which might overlook other important variables

## 4.3 [Use of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) Method to Estimate the Effects of Location Attributes on the Residential Property Values](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/295045695.pdf)

### Objective

Estimate the effect of locational attributes on property values in Kuala Lumpur

### Methodology

1.  Hedonic Pricing Model (HPM)

A standard prediction model that does not take into account characteristics such as spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity

2.  Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)\
    Built on top of the HPM to prevents issues with spatial characteristics in the data

### Learning points

![](images/litrev3.png)

This shows that while a traditional HPM can explain 73% of the variances,  adding the spatial data can improve the accuracy.

The study shows that different locational attributes

have differential spatial effects on residential property

premiums across the study area. 

### Areas for improvement

Interpretation on the GWR Results - we can use qualitative methods, such as focus groups on the affected areas, to get a better interpretation of the GWR results

## 4.4 [Modelling Housing Rents Using Spatial Autoregressive Geographically Weighted Regression: A Case Study in Cracow, Poland](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/6/346)

### Objective

Identify the determinants of rental prices in Cracow, Poland

### Methodology

1.  Ordinary Least Squares Regression

Insufficient as the model does not take into account spatial relationships

2.  Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR)

Includes a spatially lagged dependent variable to capture the influence of rental prices in nearby locations

3.  Mixed Geographically Weighted Regression - Spatial Autoregressive Model (MGWR-SAR)

Combined GWR with SAR

### Learning points

GWR-SAR performed the best, as it can take in both both spatial non-stationarity of the parameters of determinants and change over space of the spatial autoregressive parameter

### Areas for improvement

Exploring the thresholds of when and where spatial correlation and spatial heterogeneity becomes a significant factor in the analysis

Adapting the models to different spatial complexity, making it more portable and usable in different locations

# 5. Main Features

## 5.1 Interactive Map of Metro Manila and the house prices

Users can view an interactive point map of Metro Manila with some data points of houses. The map will be color-coded to show the house prices for each house in different areas. Users can click on the points to view the house prices and other details, which will be displayed on the side platform.

Users can also filter the map to show only the houses within a certain region. The map will zoom into the region so that users can see the distribution of house prices across the selected region.

Furthermore, users can input the house address of interest to get the predicted price that is calculated with our hedonic pricing model in the backend.

## 5.2 Geographically Weighted Regression Analysis Dashboard

Upon inputting the address of interest, users can go to the GWR Analysis tab to be shown a dashboard reflecting the statistics in the selected area. Statistics shown includes:

-   Graphs of Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression

-   Tables/charts listing the significant factors that affect the house prices

-   Bubble charts on the map showing the residual of the hedonic pricing

-   Bubble charts on the map showing the other statistics such as local R2 and coefficient estimates

## 5.3 Cluster Analysis on High house prices

This page will show the Spatial autocorrelation analysis of the prices of the houses in Metro Manila. We can see if there are clusters of places with high prices and low prices with the Global and Local Spatial autocorrelation analysis.
