    "text": "This project investigates room rental price prediction in Jakarta using geospatial analysis methods to assist home owners, property agents, and potential business owners in the rental market. Through Geospatial Weighted Regression, both descriptive and predictive methods, and Kernel Density Estimation techniques, we explore the spatial dynamics and determinants of rental prices across Jakarta’s diverse neighborhoods. By analyzing publicly available datasets and employing machine learning algorithms, we uncover spatial patterns, identify high-demand areas, and segment neighborhoods based on rental price similarities. The project culminates in the development of interactive visualizations that convey insights intuitively, facilitating informed decision making and strategic planning in Jakarta’s evolving rental market."

Data Importing\nThe data importing will leverage on R libraries, such as dplyr for aspatial data, and sf for geospatial data\n\n\n3. Data Wrangling\nThe imported data undergoes cleaning and preprocessing to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This stage may involve normalization, encoding categorical variables, and data transformation to ensure compatibility with analysis methods."

Histograms reveal the distribution of rental prices and other numerical variables, while box plots identify outliers and the spread of data across categorical variables.\n\n\n2. Choropleth\nThese maps provide a visual representation of rental price variations across different geographical areas, highlighting regions with higher or lower average rental prices.\n\n\n3. Kernel Density Estimation\nKDE plots help identify the density of rental properties across the city, offering insights into high-demand areas and potential patterns of spatial clustering."

This comparison sheds light on the temporal dynamics affecting rental prices and the added value of considering both spatial and temporal variations in the analysis."
